## Petri net simulation
1. Load the model called "00_03_scheduled.model" inside the folder "models"
2. Load the transformation called "T_simulator.model" inside the folder "TranslationalSemantics"

It is important to note that the "transition-firing schedule" (represented by the blue rectangle) has to be manually made to simulate a specific part or all of the parts of the model.

## Extras
Within the folder "models" exists other files called:
1. "00_00_clean_WN.model": A version of the waterway network that has not been translated to a Petri net
2. "00_01_WN_PN.model": A version of the waterway network wherin the Petri net places have been generated
3. "00_02_connected.model": An extended version of the previous point wherein the Petri net transitions and their correct connections have been made
4. "00_03_scheduled.model": An extended version of the previous point wherein the Petri net version of our schedule has been intergrated  

2 has been generated by running the transformation called "T_00_to_petrinet.model" to 1.  
3 has been generated by running the transformation called "T_01_connect_petrinet.model" to 2.  
finally, 4 has been generated by running the transformation called "T_02_add_petrinet_schedule.model" to 3.
